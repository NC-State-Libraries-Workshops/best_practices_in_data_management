  The beginning of a research project is the most crucial moment. Many of the 
  decisions that are made have a large influence on how the project will 
  progress and finish. This unit covers some of the choices that need to be
  made, and strategies for communicating them. Future units will cover some
  of the concepts touched on in more detail.

  This is a good one to start hands on. Participants can start making a plan for their 
  own current or potential new projects.
