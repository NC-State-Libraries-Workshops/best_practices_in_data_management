  The approach this tutorial takes towards data management is goal oriented in that
  we focus on techniques and tools that promote efficient, open and reproducible science.
  That being said, the process is integral to the goal. We also recognize that the 
  field of software development, especially open source software, is very similar
  to managing research and we therefore borrow considerably from tools and best practices
  that have evolved in that field over the last ten years.

instructors_note: |
  In this part perhaps share stories of bad and good things happening during
  research projects. The goal is to show that these things make you 
  more efficient, make your data easier to understand both for you and others,
  and make it more open and increase impact.
  

  
# These should resolve to files in the supporting_files directory

# The link_text can be anything you want.
